Animals - House of the rising sun

      Am   C        D        F
There is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E7
They call the Rising Sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Am    E7       Am
And God I know I'm one

   Am     C     D     F
My mother was a tailor
    Am       C       E7
She sewed my new bluejeans
   Am     C     D        F
My father was a gamblin' man
Am      E7    Am
Down in New Orleans

        Am   C       D       F
Now the only thing a gambler needs
     Am       C   E7
Is a suitcase and trunk
        Am   C    D         F
And the only time he's satisfied
   Am        E7   Am
Is when he's on a drunk

   Am   C           D      F
Oh mother tell your children
       Am      C      E7
Not to do what I have done
Am         C        D           F
Spend your lives in sin and misery
       Am           E7     Am
In the House of the Rising Sun

        Am      C           D      F
Well, I got one foot on the platform
    Am         C      E7
The other foot on the train
    Am    C       D     F
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
   Am        E7       Am
To wear that ball and chain

            Am   C        D          F
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E7
They call the Rising Sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Am    E7       Am
And God I know I'm one
